# osm_adventure :wave:

using python and SQL to interact with the OSM database.

the objective is to be able to query an area and return a map of all the power infrastructure in the area.

# main.py
run this file to call gdf2map and mlf_choropleth. the output is a folium map with infrastructure and 
choropleth of MLF values. this is preliminary

gdf2plot is in progress and aims to achieve the same thing using basemap/cartopy and matplotlib
